    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Martha Quintanilla-Ramirez I am a software developer Specializing in JavaScript with a background in finances and customer service. I assisted and trained over 100 personal bankers by reviewing court order documents and walking through loan applications. Becoming a software developer means I get to challenge myself in new ways. As a Latina, I want to showcase my skills, bridging the gap between communities of color and the tech industry. It's important to me to bring diversity to any team I work with to empower people from all walks of life. Technology is evolving rapidly, and I want to be a part of the growth and contribute in any way I can. Mentor Connect is an app myself and my team designed for underserved youths providing them a service to connect with a mentor in tech to guide them early in their education. I am looking forward to making an impact in any company I work with. Thank you ðŸ’œ",
