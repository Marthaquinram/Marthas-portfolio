      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Martha Quintanilla-Ramirez; Iâ€™m 28 years old. I am a software developer with a finance background in Seattle, WA! Before switching careers, I worked for a credit union where I was a Retail Experience Support Specialist. I assisted over 100 personal bankers with complex transactions, utilizing my problem-solving skills and attention to detail. While this career has taught me a lot and has been rewarding, I decided to switch gears and become a software developer to challenge myself. I want to prove that I can succeed in the tech world and break down any myths/stereotypes regarding females in the tech industry. It is essential to bring diversity to any team I work with to empower other people from all walks of life. Technology is evolving rapidly, and I want to be a part of the growth and contribute in any way I can. Thank you ðŸ’œ",
